# ESX_Scubadiving
Scuba gear rental and assembly for es_extended

Yesterday I saw some scubadiving release on ESX-org missing all the necessary features, so here you go.
This script is older than time itself. 

Features:
1. Scubashop in paleto
2. Usable item "scubagear"
3. Warns you before you run out of oxygen
4. Auto-set and remove scubagear
5. After diving, player receives scuba gear with empty tank and they can refill it with ESX_Crafting. Recipe not included
